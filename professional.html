            <p> Last summer I spent my summer as a software development
                intern at Sila Solutions Group!

                I had a great time building a web application with a team of 4 other interns (all from UVA - boo!).
                I really enjoyed working on a full stack web application and I dove into the Java Spring backend and ElasticSearch database especially.

                In my prior summers at JMU I've worked in physics research labs. First, I worked in a lab studying soft complex materials and packed system force interactions
                (think grains of sand in a silo). Then, I worked on a Jefferson Lab data aquisiton system for nuclear physics. It was in lab work that I discovered my passion
                for programming and got invloved in computer science courses.
